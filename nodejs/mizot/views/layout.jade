          div#welcome <span class="capital">W</span>elcome here, I'm Remi Melisson, enthusiast developer. I'm currently located in France but I plan to move to London during the 2012 summer.
          br
          p.alinea I like great code (i.e. clean, elegant, well-tested, efficient, SOLIDâ€¦) and I'm looking for a position where code quality matters. I'm passionate by my work and I pay attention to the software community. During the past years, I was involved in the research area where I learned to stand back and look ahead. 
          p.alinea I would like to join an enthusiast team, using adapted technologies in order to solve problems, challenges. Currently, I'm especially interested by scalable needs, for example in the scope of big data.
          p.alinea Here you can find information about my background and my early career. Feel free to contact me via email, Linked In or why not, smoke signals. 
        div.content.invisible_content#contact Well, you can find me <a href="http://maps.google.fr/maps/place?q=Orange+R%26D+Meylan&hl=en&cid=8451382217444420832" target="_blank">there</a> : <br /><br />

        div.content.invisible_content#work
            span Some of the projects I have been involved in the past three years :
            h3 virtual STB
            p.small I'm currently working on my Ph.D. study, which aims to propose an End2End architecture for virtualize the Orange Set Top Box into the operator infrastructure. 3 goals have been identified : deliver STB services to every home devices with rendering capabilities; move STB functions to operator infrastructure in a scalable and adaptable way; provide proxies for OTT (Over The Top : Google, Facebook...) services into the LAN across home networks standards.
            h3 Facil
            p.small Facil is a web site which allow Colombian citizens to access to administrative documents in order to let them trigger jsutice action without the need of a lawer. It is a Ruby on Rails application which will be available in a few months.
            h3 Mundle
            p.small Mundle is a tool which provide a way for dynamically convert maven artifact into OSGi bundles at runtime. Based on bnd and Maven 3 API, it allows to benefit from the Maven dependency description in order to deploy Maven artifact as bundles. This tool should facilitate the migration of standard Maven based Java project onto OSGi platforms.
            h3 FraSCAti on OSGi
            p.small FraSCAti is a Java implementation of the Service Component Architecture (SCA) standard. It relies on the Fracal component model in order to allow dynamic reconfiguration on SCA based software. I am working on a merge between SCA and OSGi concept which could clarify the different responsibilities of those specifications.
            h3 Binjiu
            p.small Binjiu is a set of facility for using UPnP protocol in order to achieve remote calls within Java distributed applications. Building on top of CyberLink for Java (which is a java implementation of UPnP protocol), it supplies the discovery benefits of UPnP to service oriented Java software.
            h3 MIND Project
            p.small MIND is a project which depend on the Minalogic global competitive cluster. This project aims to provide a model and a valid infrastructure for developing lightweight (as well as dramatically lightweight) embedded software according to component based software engineering paradigms. More precisely, we are taking part in the development of an IDE (textual and graphical integrated editors) for component architecture definition. To achieve those goals, we are using the Fractal component model and the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF, GMF, TMF-Xtext).
